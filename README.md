## Problem
The water supply has been unstable across the years in Australia. Given the heavy reliance on rainfall,
focus on water conservation has been put on streamflow control.

However, things can be done more household basis. While water consumption remains consistently high, the visualizaton on the consumption per facility is missing.

## Solution
We would like to introduce a mechanism that can encourage citizens to keep track of their water consumption,
while incorporating some social and gamification aspect so as to make water saving part of their daily life.
In this way, the small steps in water saving can be encouraged, in a fun way!

The details of solution is below:

### Data analytics dashboard
- By different time span (daily / weekly / yearly)
- Real time graphics
- Indicator of the water consumption situation

### Compare
- Historical data comparison
Recommendation
- Identify which appliance / household activity consumes most water and recommend the users with water saving tips (e.g. reuse water)

### Social
- Ranking among the neighborhood (for water saving %)

### Alert
- Send push message to users on app/email to remind that the water usage is touching the target boundary

### Incentive
- The collected points (drops) can be used for gift redemption
